# Jatui - A Java Text User Interface Library

This library is an evolution of my previous [Java Text Interface Library](https://github.com/Caleb-Leavell/TextInterface). It's been rewritten from the ground up to be less verbose and more powerful.
This is a fairly early commit, and while it's feature complete and mostly stable, thorough testing and documentation are still in progress. However, it is still usable and useful, so feel free to use it if you'd like!

To get an idea of usage, a [Demo App](https://github.com/Caleb-Leavell/Jatui/blob/main/src/main/java/com/calebleavell/jatui/Main.java) has been created that creates a simple app which generates a random number.
