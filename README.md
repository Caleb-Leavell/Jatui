# Jatui - A Java Text User Interface Library

This library is an evolution of my previous [https://github.com/Caleb-Leavell/TextInterface](Java Text Inteface Library). It's been rewritted from the ground up to be less verbose and more powerful.
This is a fairly early commit, and while it's feature complete and mostly stable, testing is still in progress and documentation is sparse. However, it is still usable and useful, so feel free to use it if you'd like!
